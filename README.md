inSided Coding Test

<h2>Hello!</h2>
<p>The main goal for me within this project was not to use any html-frameworks. I could easily have been include Bootstrap but I wanted to show how widgets can be made with some simple coding and css. I had a lot of fun with this assignment and I really liked the idea. Unfortunately 'time flies'. Now the time has come to turn this assignment in. I hope you will enjoy reviewing my code and like it!</p>

<h3>Install</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Clone this repository - git clone https://github.com/kladebo/inSided.git</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> - run: npm install</li>
    <li><a href="http://gruntjs.com/">grunt</a> - run: grunt</li>
    <li>upload the following files/dirs to the webserver:
        <ul>
            <li>favicon.ico</li>
            <li>index.html</li>
            <li>/css</li>
            <li>/img</li>
            <li>/js</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Known issues:</h3>
<h4>number 7</h4>
<p>I have tried to complete all the issues but I have failed with number 7. I couldn't find the relation within the 'data' between the filters and the filter-buttons.</p>
<h4>calendar</h4>
<p>I didn't write my own calandar widget. I think that's far beyond the scope of this assignment. I have used the calendar object from 'Nick Baicoianu' <a href="http://www.epoch-calendar.com/javascript_calendar/index.html">epoch calendar</a></p>
<h4>responsiveness</h4>
<p>The responsiveness of my solution is still a bit weak. I run out of time to make the interface 'act normal' on smaller screes. </p>
<h4>unit tests</h4>
<p>There are no unittest or e2e test implemented. I just didn't had the time. I know that's a big shame. I love the idea of these tests. With one push of a button you can test our entire project! </p>
